# AI Employee Control Plane — Business PRD

Status: Drafted October 7, 2025 · Author: Growth & Operator Workflow PM · Audience: GTM, Product, Ops

## Executive Summary

The AI Employee Control Plane transforms high-intent objectives into measurable revenue, retention, and efficiency gains by pairing objective-led planning with managed execution through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Teams can prove value in minutes via zero-privilege artifacts, then unlock connected automations once trust is earned, keeping approvals and evidence at the center of every run.

## Market Context & Problem

- Senior operators are under pressure to scale outreach, service, and internal operations without expanding headcount.
- Traditional automations demand full credentials up front, while lightweight copilots lack accountability and ROI data.
- Leadership teams need auditable artifacts, guardrails, and repeatable wins before committing budget to autonomous agents.

## Product Vision & Goals

Deliver an objective-first AI employee that plans, executes, and learns like a top operator: capability-aware, reversible, and always accountable. Success looks like every account describing a goal, seeing the smallest effective workflow, and reviewing evidence-backed results in less than 15 minutes, creating a clear path from pilot to scaled adoption.

## Target Customers & Jobs-to-Be-Done

- **Revenue Expansion Leads (GTM, agencies, growth squads):** Warm dormant accounts, launch tailored campaigns, and document ROI without hiring more SDRs.
- **Customer Operations & Support Leaders:** Compress response times, prevent churn, and uphold SLAs using blended human + agent workflows.
- **Business Operations Owners (SMB to mid-market):** Automate billing nudges, scheduling, and reporting while retaining oversight.
- **Technical Enablement Teams:** Safeguard code and integrations by routing agent-led changes through a code-only MCP with enforced approvals.
- **Executive Sponsors & Governance Officers:** Demand transparent evidence, approvals, and guardrail adherence before expanding budgets.

## Value Proposition & Differentiators

1. **Zero-to-value runway:** Composio’s catalog of 250+ toolkits across CRM, collaboration, finance, e-commerce, and vertical recipes powers artifact-first demos before credentials are shared.
2. **Proven outcomes:** Case studies such as Assista AI’s 90% reduction in go-to-market time and Fabrile’s rapid Google Workspace integrations validate business impact for stakeholders.
3. **Human-centered copilot UX:** CopilotKit-driven workspaces keep planners, reviewers, and agents in the same loop with explainable steps and suggested edits.
4. **Governed autonomy:** Role-based approvals, quiet hours, tone constraints, and rollback cues protect brand, compliance, and customer trust.
5. **Compounding library:** Successful jobs and plays become a private asset catalog, enabling franchises and agencies to scale repeatable services.

## Product Scope & Key Experiences (Business Lens)

- **Objective intake:** Structured prompts capture goal, audience, timeframe, and guardrails, producing an editable mission brief.
- **Capability grounding:** The agent surfaces relevant MCP servers and toolkits, highlighting no-auth vs. OAuth requirements for approval.
- **Plan proposals:** Users receive Top-3 Predicted Jobs and Play candidates with Why, Impact, Risk, Proof, and Undo narratives.
- **Dry-run proof packs:** Zero-privilege mode generates drafts, lists, and schedules for stakeholder review before live permissions.
- **Governed activation:** Connected mode executes the same plays through confirmed MCP toolkits with approvals, caps, and quiet hours enforced.
- **Evidence & coaching:** Dashboards highlight ROI deltas, artifacts, guardrail events, and “next best job” recommendations drawn from the library.

## Metrics & Success Criteria

- **North Star:** Weekly approved agent jobs per active account.
- **Adoption:** ≥70% of new tenants complete a Dry Run within Day 1; median time from objective to evidence under 15 minutes.
- **Expansion:** 60% of zero-privilege tenants connect at least two MCP servers within 30 days; average of three plays reused per tenant per month.
- **Retention & Advocacy:** Library reuse rate, reviewer NPS, and governance satisfaction (caps honored, rollback clarity).

## Go-to-Market & Packaging Outline

- **Private Preview (Weeks 1–6):** Co-design with three anchor customers (GTM, support, technical enablement) emphasizing zero-privilege proof packs and ROI capture.
- **Limited GA (Weeks 7–12):** Open to 20 paying tenants, launch curated play bundles (outreach, research, support), and publish evidence dashboards.
- **Scale Push (Post-Quarter):** Introduce vertical playpacks, outcome-linked pricing pilots, and joint marketing moments with Composio and CopilotKit.
- **Packaging:**
  - _Starter:_ One objective stream, limited toolkits, shared analytics snapshot for rapid pilots.
  - _Growth:_ Multiple objectives, higher job credits, library ranking, and governance routing.
  - _Scale:_ Pooled credits, executive analytics, compliance reviews, and outcome-based add-ons.

## Dependencies & Partnerships

- **Composio:** Tooling breadth, OAuth flows, and case-study storytelling to anchor proof-of-value narratives.
- **CopilotKit:** Human-in-the-loop surfaces (workspace, approvals, library) that mirror operator workflows and reinforce trust.
- **ADK & Agent Frameworks:** Objective-first orchestration, multi-agent coordination, and consistent audit trails that align with governance requirements.
- **Supabase Analytics:** Centralized queueing, evidence storage, and ROI dashboards backing enterprise reporting needs.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Value proof stalls without credentials:** Ship polished zero-privilege plays (campaign prep, competitor briefs, scheduling proposals) and spotlight upgrade pathways with case-study benchmarks.
- **Scope creep toward unsupervised automation:** Keep approvals mandatory by default, surface rollback instructions, and offer opt-in autopilot windows.
- **Tool discovery overwhelm:** Curate recommended toolkits per persona, leverage cookbook recipes, and surface relevant success stories in-product.
- **Partner dependency drift:** Schedule quarterly alignment with Composio, CopilotKit, and ADK teams on roadmap, branding, and co-marketing commitments.

## User Stories

- **Revenue Lead:** As a director of business development, I want to submit a quarterly pipeline goal and receive three ready-to-run outreach plays so I can revive dormant accounts without expanding headcount.
- **Marketing Ops Manager:** As the owner of lifecycle campaigns, I want zero-privilege plays that return enriched lead lists and draft nurture sequences so I can demonstrate lift before granting send permissions.
- **Customer Support Leader:** As a head of support, I want guardrailed automations that surface churn-risk cases, propose responses, and log evidence so my team meets SLAs confidently.
- **Finance & Admin Owner:** As an operations manager, I want approved billing nudges and scheduling workflows so I can reduce manual follow-up and missed payments.
- **Technical Enablement Lead:** As a platform engineer, I want code changes routed through a code MCP with reviewer checkpoints so I can enable agent-led fixes without compromising repo hygiene.
- **Executive Sponsor:** As a COO, I want dashboards summarizing ROI, approvals, and guardrail events so I can justify expansion and maintain compliance posture.
- **Security & Governance Officer:** As a compliance lead, I want visibility into who approved each automation, what toolkits were used, and how rollback works so I can greenlight broader usage.
- **Agency Partner:** As a service provider, I want to clone top-performing plays across clients and track performance deltas so I can package AI-led services efficiently.
