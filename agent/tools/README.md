# Tool Scaffolding

This directory will hold native Composio tool wrappers, undo plan helpers, and
score calculation utilities once the Executor pipeline is implemented.

Refer to:
- `docs/04_implementation_guide.md` — section "Tooling & Safeguards"
- `docs/06_data_intelligence.md` — telemetry requirements for tool calls
- `docs/10_composio.md` — scope negotiation and Connect Link etiquette

Remove this placeholder README after the first tool-specific module lands.
