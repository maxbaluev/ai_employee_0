# AI Employee Control Plane: Release Readiness

**Version:** 3.1 (October 2025)
**Audience:** Product, Engineering, Operations, QA, Governance, Executive Leadership
**Status:** Active release checklist and evidence framework

---

## Purpose

This document defines the cross-functional readiness criteria, evidence requirements, and sign-off process for releasing capabilities to production. It ensures that product launches maintain quality, security, compliance, and operational standards while enabling rapid iteration.

**Key Principles:**
- **Evidence-driven:** Every release backed by objective proof (test results, benchmarks, audits)
- **Cross-functional alignment:** Product, Engineering, Trust, Operations, and UX collaborate on readiness
- **Continuous validation:** Automated checks run on every build; manual reviews for major releases
- **Transparent accountability:** Clear ownership, sign-off requirements, and escalation paths

---

## Rollback & Incident Response

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical bugs affecting ≥5% of users
- Security vulnerabilities (CVSS ≥7.0)
- Performance degradation (p95 latency >2x baseline)
- Data integrity issues
- Safeguard bypass detected
- Compliance violation

### Rollback Procedures

**Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes):**
1. Disable feature flag (instant rollback for new features)
2. Alert on-call engineer and stakeholders
3. Open incident ticket with severity classification
4. Switch traffic to previous deployment (Vercel rollback, or equivalent)

**Short-Term Actions (15-60 minutes):**
1. Validate rollback success (metrics return to baseline)
2. Preserve evidence (logs, telemetry, error traces)
3. Notify affected users (if external impact)
4. Begin root cause analysis

**Follow-Up Actions (1-24 hours):**
1. Root cause identified and documented
2. Fix implemented and tested
3. Readiness re-validation completed
4. Incident retrospective scheduled
5. Runbook updated with learnings

**Owner:** On-call engineer (immediate), Engineering Lead (follow-up)
**Escalation:** VP Engineering (if >1 hour downtime or data loss)

---

## Automation & Continuous Validation

### CI/CD Gates

All PRs must pass automated gates before merge:

1. **Unit Tests:** `pnpm test:ui`, `mise run test-agent`
2. **Linting:** `pnpm run lint`, `uv run ruff check agent`
3. **Type Checking:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
4. **Security Scan:** Snyk dependency audit, SAST
5. **Accessibility:** `pnpm run test:a11y` (axe-core)
6. **Performance:** Lighthouse checks for critical pages
7. **Telemetry Validation:** `pnpm ts-node scripts/audit_telemetry_events.py --mode check`

**Enforcement:** Automated via GitHub Actions; failing checks block merge

---

### Continuous Monitoring (Post-Deployment)

**Real-Time Alerts:**
- Error rate spike (>2% for >5 minutes)
- Latency degradation (p95 >200ms sustained)
- Failed authentication attempts spike
- Safeguard violation rate increase
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Memory leak detection (heap growth >20% per hour)

**Daily Health Checks:**
- Telemetry ingestion rate (should match user activity)
- Test suite health (all passing on main branch)
- Evidence artifact freshness (no artifacts >30 days stale)
- Library embedding refresh status
- Backup completion status

**Weekly Reviews:**
- Incident frequency and MTTR trends
- Release velocity and rollback rate
- Test coverage trends
- Technical debt accumulation

**Owner:** Operations team (alerts), Engineering Manager (reviews)
