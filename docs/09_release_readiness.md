## Automated Release Gates

### CI/CD Pipeline Checks

**Note:** The term "gates" here refers to **CI/CD quality gates** (automated checks in the deployment pipeline), not the legacy "stage-gate" workflow model that has been replaced by the unified mission flow.

The following automated checks must pass before deployment:

```yaml
# Example CI/CD gates
gates:
  - name: Lint & Type Check
    command: mise run lint && pnpm tsc --noEmit
    required: true

  - name: Frontend Tests
    command: pnpm test:ui
    required: true
    coverage_threshold: 80%

  - name: Agent Evals
    command: mise run test-agent
    required: true
    pass_rate_threshold: 90%

  - name: API Tests
    command: pnpm test:api
    required: true

  - name: E2E Tests
    command: pnpm test:e2e
    required: true

  - name: Accessibility Audit
    command: pnpm run test:a11y
    required: true
    max_violations: 0

  - name: Telemetry Audit
    command: pnpm ts-node scripts/audit_telemetry_events.py --mode check
    required: true

  - name: Security Scan
    command: pnpm audit && uv pip check
    required: true
    max_severity: medium

  - name: Performance Benchmarks
    command: pnpm run test:perf
    required: true
    thresholds:
      - metric: intake_latency_p95
        max: 3000ms
      - metric: planner_latency_p95
        max: 2500ms
```

### Manual Release Gates

The following require human review:

- [ ] Product sign-off in tracker
- [ ] Engineering sign-off in tracker
- [ ] Operations sign-off in tracker
- [ ] Security sign-off in tracker (Tier 2+)
- [ ] Compliance sign-off in tracker (Tier 2+)
- [ ] UX sign-off in tracker (Tier 2+)
- [ ] Partner alignment confirmed (if applicable)

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers

Execute rollback if:
- Mission success rate drops below 90% within 1 hour of deployment
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data integrity issue detected
- Multiple user-reported incidents (SEV1 or SEV2)
- Unexpected infrastructure failure

### Rollback Steps

**1. Declare Incident**
- Incident Commander initiates rollback
- Notify stakeholders via status page and Slack

**2. Revert Deployment**

**Frontend (Next.js):**
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback <deployment-id>
# or via git
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

**Agent (FastAPI):**
```bash
# Revert to previous image
./scripts/deploy-agent.sh --version <previous-version>
# or via git
git revert <commit-hash>
./scripts/deploy-agent.sh
```

**Database (Supabase):**
```bash
# Rollback migration
supabase db rollback --version <previous-migration>
# Regenerate types
supabase gen types typescript --linked > supabase/types.ts
```

**3. Verify Rollback**
- Run smoke tests
- Verify metrics return to baseline
- Confirm user-reported issues resolved

**4. Post-Rollback**
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Update runbooks with learnings
- Plan fix and re-release

---
