# Case Study: Revenue Operations ‚Äî Dormant Account Reactivation

**Persona:** Riley Chen, Revenue Expansion Lead
**Industry:** Mid-Market B2B SaaS
**Mission Date:** October 2025
**Mission Duration:** 47 minutes (Define to Evidence)
**Outcome:** 23 personalized outreach sequences drafted, 19 approved for send

---

## Executive Summary

Riley manages a portfolio of 300+ mid-market accounts and noticed 87 high-value customers ($50K+ ARR) went dormant in Q2 2025. With Q4 approaching and a need to hit pipeline targets, Riley turned to the AI Employee Control Plane to design, validate, and execute a targeted reactivation campaign.

This case study demonstrates the **five-stage mission journey** in action:
1. **Define** ‚Äî Capture intent and safeguards
2. **Prepare** ‚Äî Validate toolkits and data coverage
3. **Plan & Approve** ‚Äî Review ranked plays and risk assessment
4. **Execute & Observe** ‚Äî Governed execution with validator oversight
5. **Reflect & Improve** ‚Äî Feedback and library contribution

---

## Stage 1: Define

### Intent Submission

Riley opens the mission workspace and pastes the following into the generative intake banner:

```
Revive our top 20 dormant accounts from Q2 with personalized outreach.
Focus on accounts with >$50K prior ARR in manufacturing vertical.
Tone should be warm and consultative, not promotional.
Send between 9am-5pm recipient local time, Tuesday-Thursday only.
Avoid accounts on the do-not-contact list.
```

### Chip Generation

Within 3 seconds, the system generates these chips:

- **Objective:** "Reactivate dormant high-value manufacturing accounts"
  _Confidence: High_

- **Audience:** "Accounts >$50K ARR, manufacturing vertical, dormant Q2 2025"
  _Confidence: High_

- **KPIs:** "Reply rate ‚â•3%, meetings booked ‚â•5, pipeline contribution $1.2M"
  _Confidence: Medium_

- **Safeguards:**
  - "Warm, consultative tone (not promotional)"
  - "Send window: 9am-5pm recipient local time, Tue-Thu only"
  - "Exclude do-not-contact list"
  _Confidence: High_

- **Timeline:** "Complete outreach sequence within 5 business days"
  _Confidence: Medium_

### User Edits

Riley notices the KPI chip suggests $1.2M pipeline but wants to be more conservative. She clicks the chip, edits it to:

```
Reply rate ‚â•3%, meetings booked ‚â•5, pipeline contribution $800K
```

She regenerates the Timeline chip to say "Complete within 3 business days" to align with her Q4 planning cycle.

### Brief Locked

Riley clicks **Accept All** (`Ctrl+Enter`). The mission brief locks and stage 2 activates.

**Telemetry Emitted:**
- `intent_submitted` (token_count: 87, safeguard_presence: true)
- `brief_generated` (chips_generated: 5, avg_confidence: 0.84)
- `chip_regenerated` (chip_type: "kpi", reason: "user_edit")
- `chip_regenerated` (chip_type: "timeline", reason: "user_edit")
- `mission_brief_locked` (final_chip_count: 5, edits_made: 2)

---

## Stage 2: Prepare

### Pinned Brief Display

The accepted chips appear in a persistent **Mission Brief Card** at the top of the workspace. Riley can edit at any time by clicking "Edit Brief."

### Toolkit Recommendations

The system suggests:

1. **HubSpot** (no-auth, read-only)
   _Rationale: "Your team's CRM. 87 accounts match criteria. Ready for enrichment."_
   _Precedent: 12 similar missions in library_
   üü¢ No-auth ready

2. **Gmail** (OAuth required, send)
   _Rationale: "Draft and send personalized emails. OAuth required for sending."_
   _Precedent: 18 missions used Gmail for outreach_
   üü° OAuth required

3. **Slack** (OAuth optional, notify)
   _Rationale: "Notify #revenue-ops when sequences are ready for review."_
   _Precedent: 8 missions used Slack notifications_
   üü° OAuth optional

Riley selects:
- ‚òë **HubSpot** (no-auth, read-only for inspection)
- ‚òê **Gmail** (defer OAuth until after approval)
- ‚òë **Slack** (authorize via Connect Link)

### OAuth Flow (Prepare Stage)

After reviewing toolkit recommendations, Riley sees that Slack requires OAuth. Inspector presents a Connect Link approval modal via chat.

Riley reviews the request:
- **Toolkit:** Slack
- **Scopes:** `chat:write`, `channels:read`
- **Purpose:** Notify #revenue-ops when sequences are ready for review

Riley clicks **Approve** ‚Üí Connect Link opens in side drawer ‚Üí She authorizes ‚Üí Inspector awaits `wait_for_connection()` ‚Üí Token stored encrypted in `mission_connections` table with mission metadata.

**Gmail Note:** Riley opts to defer Gmail OAuth until she's reviewed the plan. Inspector notes this and will present Gmail authorization after plan approval if needed.

**Toolkit Status:**
- HubSpot: üü¢ Connected (no-auth, read-only)
- Gmail: üü° Deferred (will authorize after reviewing draft strategy)
- Slack: üü¢ Connected (OAuth complete via Inspector)

### Data Inspection

Riley clicks **Inspect Data Coverage**. The system runs read-only MCP probes:

- **HubSpot Preview:**
  - 87 contacts match filters
  - Sample fields: `company_name`, `industry`, `arr_value`, `last_touch_date`, `owner_email`
  - Redaction applied to PII fields
  - Coverage meter: **92%** (sufficient)

- **Safeguard Review:**
  - Do-not-contact list: 4 accounts excluded (83 remain)
  - Timezone data available: ‚úì
  - Send window validation: ‚úì

**Coverage Summary:**
- ‚úì Objectives (100%)
- ‚úì Contacts (HubSpot preview: 83 contacts)
- ‚úì Safeguards (tone, timing, exclusions validated)
- ‚úì Automation readiness (92%)

Riley proceeds to Stage 3.

**Telemetry Emitted:**
- `toolkit_recommended` (toolkit_id: "hubspot", precedent_count: 12)
- `toolkit_recommended` (toolkit_id: "gmail", precedent_count: 18)
- `toolkit_recommended` (toolkit_id: "slack", precedent_count: 8)
- `toolkit_selected` (toolkit_id: "hubspot", auth_status: "no_auth_ready")
- `toolkit_selected` (toolkit_id: "slack", auth_status: "oauth_complete")
- `data_preview_generated` (source: "hubspot", records_matched: 83, coverage: 0.92)
- `safeguard_reviewed` (safeguard_type: "do_not_contact", exclusions_applied: 4)

---

## Stage 3: Plan & Approve

### Planner Receives Established Connections

Planner agent receives:
- **Established connections:** HubSpot (no-auth, read-only), Slack (OAuth complete)
- **Deferred:** Gmail (awaiting approval for send scope)
- **Data investigation insights:** 83 contacts matched, 92% coverage, 4 excluded via do-not-contact

### Planner Streaming

The Planner agent assembles mission plays based on tool usage patterns and data investigation, annotating sequencing, resource requirements, and undo affordances for each option. Riley sees:

**Play 1: "Targeted Q2 Win-Back Campaign"**
_Confidence: 0.87 ¬∑ Library Match: 5 similar missions_

**Rationale:**
"Leverages HubSpot enrichment (already connected) to generate personalized email drafts. Emphasizes warm, consultative tone from safeguards. Schedules review before send. Requires Gmail OAuth for final send step‚ÄîInspector will present approval if you proceed."

**Steps:**
1. Enrich 83 contacts with recent activity, ARR changes, industry trends (HubSpot, no-auth)
2. Generate personalized email drafts (templated with placeholders) using data investigation insights
3. Apply tone safeguards (validator auto-fix enabled)
4. Package for review and approval
5. [Conditional] Send via Gmail‚ÄîInspector will request OAuth if approved

**Undo Plan:**
"Drafts discarded from workspace. No external mutations until Gmail OAuth + final send approval."

**Safeguards Enforced:**
- ‚úì Warm, consultative tone (from Define stage)
- ‚úì Send window: 9am-5pm local time, Tue-Thu (from Define stage)
- ‚úì Do-not-contact exclusions (validated during Prepare)
- ‚úì Validator monitoring enabled

**Tool Usage Patterns Detected:**
- HubSpot: Read-only enrichment (83 contact records)
- Gmail: Deferred send (pending approval)
- Slack: Notification upon completion

---

**Play 2: "Multi-Touch Sequence with LinkedIn Outreach"**
_Confidence: 0.72 ¬∑ Library Match: 2 similar missions_

**Rationale:**
"Combines email + LinkedIn connection requests. Higher touch effort but may yield better engagement."

Riley dismisses Play 2 (prefers email-only for this campaign).

---

**Play 3: "Automated Drip Campaign via HubSpot Workflows"**
_Confidence: 0.65 ¬∑ Library Match: 1 mission_

**Rationale:**
"Uses HubSpot sequences (requires Enterprise tier). Lower personalization."

Riley dismisses Play 3 (wants manual approval before sends).

### Play Selection

Riley clicks **Select Play 1**. The system displays a risk matrix:

| Dimension        | Assessment | Notes                                    |

**Toolkit:** Gmail
**Scopes:** `gmail.send`, `gmail.compose`
**Purpose:** Send personalized outreach emails (83 drafts)

Riley clicks **Approve** ‚Üí Connect Link opens ‚Üí She authorizes ‚Üí Inspector logs granted scopes ‚Üí Planner confirms all required connections are now established.
