## Journey Snapshot

`Home → Define → Prepare → Plan → Approve → Execute → Reflect`

| Stage | What Riley Experiences | Telemetry Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Home** | Mission tile shows a green readiness badge (HubSpot read, Gmail draft, Slack notify). Live checklist reminds her of tone + timing safeguards from the last run. | `home_tile_opened`, `readiness_badge_rendered` |
| **Define** | Intent banner captures “Re-engage dormant manufacturing accounts >$50K ARR” with plain-language objective, KPI, safeguard, and timeline lines. KPI edited to “Reply ≥3%, $750K pipeline lift,” timeline tightened to 3 days. | `intent_submitted`, `brief_generated`, `mission_brief_locked` |
| **Prepare** | Tool cards explain scopes in human terms: **HubSpot** (review account history), **Gmail** (draft/send), **Slack** (notify revenue channel). Slack authorised inline; Gmail send scope deferred with amber badge. Data clarity preview confirms 20 accounts, timezone coverage, do-not-contact exclusions. | `toolkit_recommended`, `toolkit_connected`, `data_preview_generated`, `composio_auth_flow` |
| **Plan** | Best Plan card “Consultative Win-Back Sprint” appears first with outcome, effort bar, safeguards, undo window. Alternatives collapse into an accordion. Alert rail notes Gmail send scope deferred (draft-only run still allowed). | `planner_candidate_generated`, `plan_ranked`, `plan_adjusted` |
| **Approve** | Approval sheet summarises impact, safeguards, undo path, outstanding scopes. Riley inlines Gmail approval, badge flips back to green, and she confirms with a justification note for audit. | `approval_requested`, `composio_auth_flow`, `plan_approved` |
| **Execute** | Live checklist tracks `Enrich contacts`, `Draft outreach`, `Notify Slack`. Undo banner offers 10-minute rollback (“Drafts only; no sends yet”). Validator softens six greetings, rewrites two CTAs, all surfaced via alert rail. | `execution_started`, `execution_step_completed`, `validator_alert_raised`, `undo_available` |
| **Reflect** | Outcome snapshot shows “20 drafts · 4 safeguards reinforced · 2 validator assists · 2.5 h saved.” Evidence gallery bundles contact list, draft set, validator report. Feedback drawer captures 5★ rating + note (“Add LinkedIn handles next time”). | `mission_completed`, `evidence_opened`, `feedback_submitted`, `library_contribution` |

## Stage Detail

### Home — Mission Launcher
- Single-surface workspace restores pinned brief + last safeguards.
- Green readiness badge reassures Riley that no blockers exist before she even opens the mission.

### Define — Intent in Plain Language
- Conversational input, immediate conversion into human-readable fields, chips only appear after lock for quick edits later.
- Autosave covers offline drafting; inline tips explain why each field matters.

### Prepare — Tooling & Coverage
- Tool cards highlight precedent missions and plain-language scopes (“Send warm outreach email drafts”).
- Readiness badge toggles amber when Gmail send scope pending; Slack connect link fulfilled in 30 seconds.
- Data clarity preview exposes VIP badges and duplicate clusters for 20 accounts so Riley can trust targeting.

### Plan — Best Play First
- Best plan centres on staged outreach across three days; undo window called out in-line.
- Alternatives include “Higher precision, lower reach” and “Automation-first drip”; both collapse until tapped.
- Adjustments strip offers volume slider (20→40 accounts) and tone toggle; Riley keeps defaults.

### Approve — Trust Gate
- Approval surface presents impact summary, safeguards, undo, outstanding scopes—all in one printable panel.
- Riley approves Gmail scope in the same modal; governance-ready audit trail captures reason + timestamp.

### Execute — Guided Run
- Live checklist keeps Riley informed without needing raw logs; alert rail surfaces only actionable items.
- Validator auto-fixes highlight what changed (“Softened CTA for compliance”), building confidence.
- Undo banner remains sticky with impact summary until window expires or she finalises.

### Reflect — Outcome Snapshot
- Outcome card, evidence gallery, and two-tap feedback funnel learnings into the library.
- Follow-up checklist schedules Gmail send and posts Slack notification, keeping Riley on track post-mission.
