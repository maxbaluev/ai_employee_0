# Case Study: Professional AI Programmer — Full-Stack Feature Delivery

**Persona:** Jordan Nakamura, Founder & Solo Technical Lead
**Industry:** Early-Stage B2B SaaS Startup
**Mission Date:** October 2025
**Mission Duration:** 2 hours 18 minutes (Define to Evidence)
**Outcome:** Authentication system refactored, 3 critical bugs fixed, 127 unit tests passing, production deployment validated

---

## Executive Summary

Jordan is a technical founder building a SaaS product for legal document automation. After launching an MVP, they discovered authentication inconsistencies causing intermittent user logouts, incomplete session persistence, and a critical vulnerability flagged by a security audit. With a product demo scheduled in 72 hours and limited time to handle both engineering and business development, Jordan turned to the AI Employee Control Plane to diagnose, plan, and execute a comprehensive authentication overhaul.

This case study demonstrates the **five-stage mission journey** applied to complex software engineering work:
1. **Define** — Capture technical intent with safeguards and acceptance criteria
2. **Prepare** — Validate toolkits and repository data coverage
3. **Plan & Approve** — Review ranked implementation strategies with rollback plans
4. **Execute & Observe** — Governed code changes with validator oversight and test coverage
5. **Reflect & Improve** — Code review, library contribution, and technical debt tracking

---

## Stage 1: Define

### Intent Submission

Jordan opens the mission workspace at 9:47am and enters the following technical brief:

```
Refactor authentication system to fix session persistence bugs and security vulnerabilities.
Current issues:
- Users logged out randomly after 15-30 mins (JWT refresh race condition)
- Auth tokens not properly invalidated on logout
- Missing CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- Inconsistent error handling in auth middleware

Requirements:
- Fix JWT refresh logic (use sliding window)
- Implement proper token revocation list
- Add CSRF tokens to all POST/PUT/DELETE routes
- Centralize auth error handling
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing user sessions
- All tests must pass
- Zero downtime deployment

Tech stack: Next.js 14, Supabase Auth, TypeScript
Target: Production deployment ready by end of day
```

### Chip Generation

Within 4 seconds, the system generates these chips:

- **Objective:** "Refactor authentication system for security and reliability"
  _Confidence: High_

- **Technical Scope:** "JWT refresh logic, token revocation, CSRF protection, error handling centralization"
  _Confidence: High_

- **Acceptance Criteria:** "All tests passing, backward compatible, zero downtime deployment, security audit compliance"
  _Confidence: High_

- **KPIs:** "Session persistence >99.9%, logout success rate 100%, vulnerability count 0, test coverage ≥85%"
  _Confidence: Medium_

- **Safeguards:**
  - "Maintain backward compatibility with existing sessions"
  - "Zero downtime deployment (no breaking changes)"
  - "All tests must pass before merge"
  - "Code review required for auth changes"
  - "Rollback plan for production deployment"
  _Confidence: High_

- **Timeline:** "Complete implementation and deployment within 8 hours"
  _Confidence: Medium_

### User Edits

Jordan reviews the chips and makes two adjustments:

1. **KPI Chip Edit:** Changes test coverage requirement from "≥85%" to "≥90%" to align with team standards.

2. **Safeguards Addition:** Adds explicit safeguard: "No direct database schema changes without migration review"

3. **Timeline Adjustment:** Updates to "Complete core implementation in 6 hours, reserve 2 hours for deployment validation"

### Brief Locked

Jordan reviews all chips, ensures security requirements are captured, and clicks **Accept All** (`Ctrl+Enter`). The mission brief locks at 9:51am, and Stage 2 activates.

**Telemetry Emitted:**
- `intent_submitted` (token_count: 142, safeguard_presence: true, technical_context: "auth_refactor")
- `brief_generated` (chips_generated: 6, avg_confidence: 0.86, domain: "software_engineering")
- `chip_regenerated` (chip_type: "kpi", reason: "user_edit", field: "test_coverage")
- `chip_modified` (chip_type: "safeguards", action: "add", content: "no_schema_changes")
- `chip_regenerated` (chip_type: "timeline", reason: "user_edit")
- `mission_brief_locked` (final_chip_count: 6, edits_made: 3, technical_complexity: "high")

---

## Stage 2: Prepare

### Pinned Brief Display

The accepted chips appear in a persistent **Mission Brief Card** with expandable technical details. Jordan can toggle between "Business View" and "Technical View" — the latter shows parsed requirements mapped to affected code modules.

### Toolkit Recommendations

The system analyzes the codebase and suggests:

1. **GitHub** (no-auth, read/write)
   _Rationale: "Primary code repository. 23 files in auth module, 87 tests in test suite. Ready for code analysis."_
   _Precedent: 34 similar refactoring missions in library_
   🟢 No-auth ready (uses GITHUB_TOKEN from environment)

2. **Supabase** (API key required, database inspection)
   _Rationale: "Auth provider and database. Need to validate session schema, analyze current auth patterns."_
   _Precedent: 18 missions used Supabase for auth work_
   🟢 API key detected in `.env.local`

3. **Linear** (OAuth optional, issue tracking)
   _Rationale: "Track implementation progress, link commits to issues, update stakeholders."_
   _Precedent: 12 missions used Linear for task management_
   🟡 OAuth optional

4. **Vercel** (API token required, deployment)
   _Rationale: "Production deployment and preview environments. Needed for zero-downtime validation."_
   _Precedent: 9 missions used Vercel for deployment_
   🟡 API token required

Jordan selects:
- ☑ **GitHub** (no-auth, read/write for code changes)
- ☑ **Supabase** (API key ready for schema inspection)
- ☑ **Linear** (defer OAuth, will update manually)
- ☑ **Vercel** (authorize via API token from clipboard)

### OAuth & API Token Flow

**Vercel:** Jordan pastes API token → System validates scopes (`read`, `write`, `deploy`) → Token stored encrypted in `oauth_tokens` table.

**Toolkit Status:**
- GitHub: 🟢 Connected (GITHUB_TOKEN from env)
- Supabase: 🟢 Connected (API key validated)
- Linear: 🟡 Deferred (manual updates)
- Vercel: 🟢 Connected (API token authorized)

### Repository & Data Inspection

Jordan clicks **Inspect Codebase Coverage**. The system runs read-only analysis:

**GitHub Repository Preview:**
- Repository: `jordan-nakamura/legaltech-mvp`
- Branch: `main` (protection rules: 2 reviewers, CI must pass)
- Auth module files identified: 23 files
  - `src/lib/auth/jwt.ts` (JWT refresh logic)
  - `src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` (Auth middleware)
  - `src/lib/auth/session.ts` (Session management)
  - `src/lib/auth/csrf.ts` (CSRF protection — currently minimal)
  - `src/pages/api/auth/[...].ts` (Auth API routes)
- Test coverage: 127 tests, 82% coverage (target: 90%)
- Dependencies: `jsonwebtoken`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `cookie`, `jose`

**Supabase Schema Preview:**
- Table: `auth.sessions` (custom session tracking)
- Table: `auth.refresh_tokens` (current implementation: in-memory, needs persistence)
- Table: `users` (254 active users)
- Function: `check_session_validity()` (Postgres function for session checks)

**Security Scan Results:**
- 🔴 Critical: JWT refresh race condition (CVE-like pattern detected)
- 🟡 Medium: CSRF protection incomplete on 7 endpoints
- 🟡 Medium: Token revocation not persisted
- 🟢 Low: Error messages expose internal state (info leak)

**Coverage Summary:**
- ✓ Code access (GitHub: 23 auth files, 127 tests)
- ✓ Database schema (Supabase: 3 tables, 1 function)
- ✓ Deployment pipeline (Vercel: 3 environments)
- ✓ Security context (4 vulnerabilities identified)
- ✓ Safeguards (backward compatibility, zero downtime validated)
- ✓ Automation readiness (94%)

Jordan reviews the inspection report, noting the JWT race condition severity. They proceed to Stage 3.

## Stage 3: Plan & Approve

### Planner Streaming

The Planner agent begins streaming candidate implementation strategies. Jordan sees:

**Play 1: "Incremental Auth Hardening with Feature Flags"**
_Confidence: 0.91 · Library Match: 8 similar auth refactors_

**Rationale:**
"Address critical JWT race condition first, then layer in CSRF and token revocation. Use feature flags to toggle new auth logic independently. Maintains backward compatibility. Enables progressive rollout with instant rollback."

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Phase 1 — JWT Refresh Fix (Critical):**
   - Refactor `src/lib/auth/jwt.ts` to use sliding window with mutex locking
   - Add Redis-backed refresh token store (Supabase integration)
   - Implement idempotent refresh endpoint with debouncing
   - Add comprehensive unit tests (target: 95% coverage for auth module)

2. **Phase 2 — Token Revocation:**
   - Create `auth.token_revocation` table (migration script)
   - Update logout handler to persist revocation entries
   - Add middleware check against revocation list
   - Implement TTL-based cleanup job

3. **Phase 3 — CSRF Protection:**
   - Add `csrf.ts` module with double-submit cookie pattern
   - Instrument all state-changing API routes
   - Add CSRF validation to existing middleware chain
   - Update frontend to include CSRF tokens in requests

4. **Phase 4 — Error Handling Centralization:**
   - Create unified `AuthError` class hierarchy
   - Update all auth modules to use centralized error handlers
   - Sanitize error messages for production
   - Add structured logging for debugging

5. **Phase 5 — Testing & Deployment:**
   - Run full test suite (target: 127+ tests passing, 90%+ coverage)
   - Create preview deployment on Vercel
   - Manual QA: session persistence, logout, edge cases
   - Production deployment with monitoring

**Undo Plan:**
"Feature flags allow instant rollback per phase. Database migrations use reversible scripts. Preview deployment validates changes before production. Rollback steps: (1) disable feature flags, (2) revert migrations if schema changed, (3) rollback Vercel deployment to previous version."

**Safeguards Enforced:**
- ✓ Backward compatibility (feature flags isolate changes)
- ✓ Zero downtime (progressive rollout, no breaking schema changes)
- ✓ Test coverage (90%+ enforced before merge)
- ✓ Code review (automated PR created for review)
- ✓ Rollback plan (multi-layer rollback strategy)

**Risk Assessment:**
| Dimension        | Assessment | Notes                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity**   | High       | 5 phases, 23 files, database changes            |
| **Impact**       | Critical   | Affects all 254 active users, auth is core      |
| **Reversibility**| High       | Feature flags + migration rollback + deployment |
| **Test Coverage**| Strong     | 127 existing tests + 45 new tests planned       |

---

**Play 2: "Complete Auth Rewrite with Next-Auth.js Migration"**
_Confidence: 0.68 · Library Match: 2 migrations_

**Rationale:**
"Replace custom auth with battle-tested Next-Auth.js. Solves all issues but requires significant migration effort, data migration risk, and potential downtime."

Jordan dismisses Play 2 (too risky for 72-hour deadline, prefers incremental approach).

---

**Play 3: "Hot-Patch JWT Race Condition Only"**
_Confidence: 0.54 · Library Match: 4 quick fixes_

**Rationale:**
"Address only the critical JWT bug with minimal changes. Defer CSRF and token revocation. Fast but leaves medium-severity issues unresolved."

Jordan dismisses Play 3 (wants comprehensive fix, not band-aid).

### Validator Oversight

The Validator agent monitors each phase with real-time checks:

**Phase 1 — JWT Refresh:**
- ✓ Mutex implementation prevents race conditions
- ✓ Refresh token TTL configured correctly (7 days)
- ✓ Idempotency key prevents duplicate refreshes
- ⚠ **Auto-fix Applied:** Added exponential backoff for refresh retries (best practice)

**Phase 2 — Token Revocation:**
- ✓ Migration script is reversible (includes `down` migration)
- ✓ Revocation table has proper indexes for performance
- ✓ TTL cleanup job runs every 6 hours
- ⚠ **Auto-fix Applied:** Added database index on `token_hash` column for O(1) lookups

**Phase 3 — CSRF Protection:**
- ✓ Double-submit cookie pattern correctly implemented
- ✓ All 7 state-changing routes instrumented
- ✓ CSRF tokens use cryptographically secure randomness
- ⚠ **Alert Raised:** One endpoint (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) should be exempt from CSRF (webhook endpoint)
  - **Resolution:** Jordan reviews alert, confirms exemption, adds comment to code

**Phase 4 — Error Handling:**
- ✓ Error messages sanitized (no internal paths exposed)
- ✓ Structured logging includes correlation IDs
- ✓ AuthError classes follow TypeScript best practices
- ✓ No regressions in error handling

**Phase 5 — Testing & Deployment:**
- ✓ Test coverage 92% (exceeds 90% target)
- ✓ All 172 tests passing
- ✓ TypeScript strict mode enabled, 0 errors
- ✓ Preview deployment healthy (status: 200, auth flow tested)

### Live Code Review Panel

Jordan sees a split-pane view:
- **Left:** Original code with annotations
- **Right:** Refactored code with highlights
- **Bottom:** Validator comments and auto-fixes

Example diff for `src/lib/auth/jwt.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (vulnerable to race conditions)
export async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string) {
  const decoded = jwt.verify(refreshToken, SECRET);
  const newToken = jwt.sign({ userId: decoded.userId }, SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
  return newToken;
}

// AFTER (race condition fixed, Redis-backed)
export async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string) {
  const lockKey = `refresh:${hashToken(refreshToken)}`;

  // Acquire distributed lock (prevents concurrent refreshes)
  const lock = await acquireLock(lockKey, { ttl: 5000 });
  if (!lock) {
    throw new AuthError('REFRESH_IN_PROGRESS', 'Token refresh already in progress');
  }

  try {
    // Check if token is revoked
    const isRevoked = await checkRevocation(refreshToken);
    if (isRevoked) {
      throw new AuthError('TOKEN_REVOKED', 'Refresh token has been revoked');
    }

    // Verify and decode token
    const decoded = jwt.verify(refreshToken, SECRET) as JWTPayload;

    // Store refresh in Redis with sliding window
    const newAccessToken = jwt.sign(
      { userId: decoded.userId },
      SECRET,
      { expiresIn: '15m' }
    );

    await storeTokenMetadata(refreshToken, {
      lastRefresh: Date.now(),
      accessToken: hashToken(newAccessToken)
    });

    return newAccessToken;
  } finally {
    await releaseLock(lock);
  }
}
```

**Validator Comment:**
✓ Excellent: Mutex prevents race conditions
✓ Revocation check added
✓ Sliding window implemented with Redis
⚠ Consider: Add rate limiting for refresh attempts (implemented as auto-fix)

### Undo Bar & Rollback Plan

Jordan sees an undo countdown with multi-layer rollback options:

```
Undo available until production deployment.

Current state: Preview deployment (isolated environment)
Impact: No production users affected yet
Rollback options:
  1. Discard PR and delete branch (full rollback)
  2. Disable feature flags (instant rollback after prod deploy)
  3. Revert database migration (if needed)
  4. Rollback Vercel deployment (one-click)

Next steps:
  • Manual QA on preview environment
  • Code review approval (PR #47)
  • Production deployment (canary rollout)
```

Jordan does not trigger undo. They proceed to manual QA on preview environment.

### Manual QA on Preview (12:24pm - 12:41pm)

Jordan tests the preview deployment:

**Test Cases:**
1. ✓ User login (email/password)
2. ✓ Session persistence (refresh browser, still logged in)
3. ✓ JWT refresh (wait 10 minutes, verify auto-refresh)
4. ✓ Logout (verify token revocation, cannot reuse token)
5. ✓ CSRF protection (try POST without CSRF token — blocked ✓)
6. ✓ Concurrent login attempts (no race conditions ✓)
7. ✓ Error handling (friendly messages, no internal leaks ✓)

**QA Notes:**
- Session persistence works flawlessly (waited 20 mins, no logout)
- JWT refresh is seamless (no visible UI interruption)
- CSRF blocking works as expected
- Error messages are user-friendly

Jordan approves the preview and proceeds to production deployment.

## Stage 5: Reflect & Improve

### Production Deployment (12:42pm)

Jordan initiates production deployment via Vercel:

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Canary rollout: 10% → 50% → 100% over 2 hours
- Database migration: Applied during 10% phase (reversible)
- Feature flags: Enabled progressively per rollout phase
- Monitoring: Real-time auth success rate, error rate, latency

**Deployment Timeline:**
- 12:42pm: Database migration applied ✓ (auth.token_revocation table created)
- 12:43pm: 10% rollout ✓ (26 users on new auth system)
  - Monitoring: Auth success rate 100%, avg latency 42ms
- 12:58pm: 50% rollout ✓ (127 users on new auth system)
  - Monitoring: Auth success rate 100%, avg latency 38ms
- 1:13pm: 100% rollout ✓ (254 users on new auth system)
  - Monitoring: Auth success rate 100%, avg latency 35ms, 0 errors

**Post-Deployment Monitoring (1:13pm - 2:00pm):**
- Session persistence: 100% (no unexpected logouts)
- JWT refresh rate: 847 refreshes, 0 failures
- Token revocations: 23 logout events, all tokens revoked successfully
- CSRF blocks: 3 attempted requests without CSRF token, all blocked ✓
- Error rate: 0.02% (expected baseline, unrelated to auth)

Jordan marks deployment as successful at 2:05pm.

### Feedback Drawer

Jordan opens the feedback drawer at 2:07pm and provides:

**Quick Reaction:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)

**Effort Saved:** "Estimated 12-16 hours of manual coding, debugging, and testing compressed into 2.5 hours with AI assistance"

**Qualitative Feedback:**
```
Incredible value for a solo founder. The phased approach gave me confidence
at each step, and the validator caught issues I would have missed (like the
DB index and webhook CSRF exemption). The preview environment let me QA
before production, and the canary rollout ensured zero downtime.

The code quality is production-ready — clean, well-tested, and follows
TypeScript best practices. The auto-generated PR made code review easy.

This mission resolved a critical security vulnerability, improved UX
(no more random logouts), and gave me peace of mind before the demo.
```

**Suggested Improvement:**
```
Would love deeper integration with Linear — auto-create issues, link commits,
update status automatically. Also, consider adding performance profiling
to the preview deployment (e.g., Lighthouse scores for auth flows).
```

### Code Review & Merge

Jordan requests code review from a trusted advisor. The PR (#47) is reviewed and approved:

**Reviewer Comments:**
```
Excellent work! The JWT refresh logic is robust, CSRF implementation is
textbook, and test coverage is comprehensive. Minor suggestions:
- Consider adding rate limiting to login endpoint (follow-up)
- Document the revocation cleanup job interval in README (follow-up)

Approving for merge. Ship it!
```

Jordan merges PR #47 at 2:18pm. The feature branch is deleted, and production deployment is finalized.

### Library Contribution

The system prompts:

```
This play performed exceptionally well and matches 8 similar auth refactoring missions.
Would you like to contribute it to the developer community library?

Contribution impact:
- Helps other developers facing similar auth issues
- Creates reusable patterns for JWT refresh, CSRF, token revocation
- Builds trust through transparent success metrics
```

Jordan clicks **Pin to Library** and adds tags:
- `authentication`
- `security`
- `jwt-refresh`
- `csrf-protection`
- `nextjs`
- `supabase`
- `production-ready`

Jordan adds a public note:
```
Comprehensive auth refactor for Next.js + Supabase apps. Fixes JWT race
conditions, adds CSRF protection, implements token revocation, and
centralizes error handling. Includes feature flags, migration scripts,
and 92% test coverage. Zero downtime deployment validated.
```

The play is now available in the public library with full anonymized telemetry.

## Key Takeaways

### What Worked Well

1. **Phased Implementation:** Breaking the refactor into 5 phases provided clear checkpoints and confidence at each step.

2. **Validator Oversight:** Auto-fixes (exponential backoff, DB index, rate limiting) improved code quality beyond Jordan's initial implementation.

3. **Preview Environment:** Manual QA on preview deployment caught no issues (all tests passed), but provided psychological safety before production rollout.

4. **Canary Deployment:** Progressive rollout (10% → 50% → 100%) ensured zero downtime and instant rollback capability.

5. **Test Coverage Enforcement:** 92% coverage target ensured comprehensive validation, catching edge cases before production.

6. **Library Precedent:** Planner leveraged 8 similar auth refactoring missions, providing battle-tested implementation patterns.

7. **Evidence Bundle:** Comprehensive artifacts (PR, tests, security report, migration scripts) provided complete audit trail and documentation.

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Linear Integration:** Jordan requested deeper integration for auto-creating follow-up issues and linking commits.

2. **Performance Profiling:** Suggested adding Lighthouse scores or performance metrics to preview deployments.

3. **Rate Limiting:** Identified as follow-up (not included in initial scope due to time constraints).

4. **Documentation Automation:** Some documentation updates (README, cleanup job interval) required manual follow-up.

### Safeguards in Action

- **Backward Compatibility:** Feature flags enabled progressive rollout without breaking existing sessions (254 users unaffected during deployment).

- **Zero Downtime:** Canary deployment strategy ensured no service interruptions (0 minutes downtime).

- **Test Coverage Enforcement:** 92% coverage requirement caught 12 edge cases during development, preventing production bugs.

- **Code Review Gate:** Automated PR required review before merge, catching 2 minor follow-up improvements.

- **Rollback Plan:** Multi-layer rollback strategy (feature flags, migration reversal, deployment rollback) provided confidence to deploy to production.

- **Validator Monitoring:** 3 auto-fixes and 1 alert improved code quality and security posture.

- **Audit Trail:** Complete telemetry and evidence bundle provided compliance documentation for security audit.

### Developer Experience Insights

**Jordan's Reflection:**
```
As a solo founder, this mission was a game-changer. I was able to tackle
a complex, critical refactor in 2.5 hours that would have taken me 2+ days
of focused work. The validator caught issues I would have missed, the phased
approach gave me confidence to ship to production, and the evidence bundle
provided documentation for our security audit.

The canary rollout meant I could sleep soundly after deployment, knowing
that rollback was instant if needed. The library contribution felt rewarding —
knowing my solution might help other developers facing similar challenges.

This mission bought me time to focus on customer demos and business development
while ensuring our technical foundation is rock-solid. I'd rate this as one of
the most valuable tools in my startup toolkit.

## Technical Deep Dive: JWT Refresh Race Condition Fix

### Problem Analysis

**Original Implementation (Vulnerable):**
```typescript
export async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string) {
  const decoded = jwt.verify(refreshToken, SECRET);
  const newToken = jwt.sign({ userId: decoded.userId }, SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
  return newToken;
}
```

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Race Condition:** Multiple concurrent refresh attempts could generate conflicting tokens
2. **No Revocation Check:** Revoked tokens could still be refreshed
3. **No Idempotency:** Duplicate refresh requests created multiple tokens
4. **No Rate Limiting:** Attackers could spam refresh endpoint

### Solution Architecture

**Refactored Implementation (Secure):**
```typescript
export async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string) {
  const lockKey = `refresh:${hashToken(refreshToken)}`;

  // 1. Acquire distributed lock (prevents concurrent refreshes)
  const lock = await acquireLock(lockKey, { ttl: 5000 });
  if (!lock) {
    throw new AuthError('REFRESH_IN_PROGRESS', 'Token refresh already in progress');
  }

  try {
    // 2. Check if token is revoked
    const isRevoked = await checkRevocation(refreshToken);
    if (isRevoked) {
      throw new AuthError('TOKEN_REVOKED', 'Refresh token has been revoked');
    }

    // 3. Verify and decode token
    const decoded = jwt.verify(refreshToken, SECRET) as JWTPayload;

    // 4. Check rate limiting
    await enforceRateLimit(`user:${decoded.userId}:refresh`, {
      max: 10,
      window: '1m'
    });

    // 5. Generate new access token
    const newAccessToken = jwt.sign(
      { userId: decoded.userId },
      SECRET,
      { expiresIn: '15m' }
    );

    // 6. Store refresh metadata (sliding window)
    await storeTokenMetadata(refreshToken, {
      lastRefresh: Date.now(),
      accessToken: hashToken(newAccessToken),
      expiresAt: Date.now() + 15 * 60 * 1000
    });

    return newAccessToken;
  } finally {
    // 7. Always release lock
    await releaseLock(lock);
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Distributed Lock (Redis):** Prevents concurrent refreshes using mutex pattern
- **Revocation Check:** Queries `auth.token_revocation` table before issuing new token
- **Idempotency:** Lock ensures single refresh per token, even with duplicate requests
- **Rate Limiting:** Enforces max 10 refreshes per minute per user
- **Sliding Window:** Metadata tracking enables sophisticated token lifecycle management
- **Error Handling:** Centralized `AuthError` classes with correlation IDs for debugging

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests: 12 scenarios (race conditions, revocation, rate limiting, edge cases)
- Integration tests: 8 scenarios (Redis lock, database queries, error flows)
- Load tests: 500 concurrent refresh requests (0 race conditions detected)
