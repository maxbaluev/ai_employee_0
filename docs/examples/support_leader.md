# Case Study: Support Operations — High-Priority Ticket Triage & Response

**Persona:** Sam Martinez, Customer Support Operations Lead
**Industry:** Enterprise SaaS Platform (Healthcare Vertical)
**Mission Date:** October 2025
**Mission Duration:** 32 minutes (Define to Evidence)
**Outcome:** 47 tickets triaged, 12 high-priority responses drafted, 3 escalations routed

---

## Executive Summary

Sam manages a support team handling 200+ tickets daily across Zendesk. On Monday morning, a product release triggered a spike in high-priority tickets related to API authentication failures. Sam needed to quickly triage tickets, draft responses, and escalate critical issues to engineering—all while maintaining SLA compliance and consistent tone.

This case study demonstrates how the **five-stage mission journey** enables rapid, governed support operations:

1. **Define** — Capture triage intent and SLA safeguards
2. **Prepare** — Validate Zendesk access and knowledge base coverage
3. **Plan & Approve** — Review triage plays and escalation criteria
4. **Execute & Observe** — Governed ticket processing with validator oversight
5. **Reflect & Improve** — Capture learnings and update response templates

---

## Stage 1: Define

### Intent Submission

Sam opens the Control Plane at 9:47am and enters:

```
Triage all high-priority tickets created in the last 4 hours related to API errors.
Categorize by issue type (auth, rate-limit, timeout).
Draft empathetic responses for resolvable issues using KB articles.
Escalate critical issues to #eng-oncall with context.
Maintain <2 hour first response SLA.
Avoid technical jargon in customer-facing responses.
```

### Chip Generation

The system generates chips in 2.8 seconds:

- **Objective:** "Triage high-priority API error tickets and draft responses"

## Stage 2: Prepare

### Toolkit Recommendations

The system suggests:

1. **Zendesk** (OAuth required, read + comment)
   _Rationale: "Your ticketing system. 47 high-priority tickets match criteria. OAuth required for read/comment."_
   _Precedent: 23 similar support missions in library_
   🟡 OAuth required

2. **Confluence** (OAuth optional, read KB articles)
   _Rationale: "Access verified KB articles for response drafting. OAuth for private pages."_
   _Precedent: 15 missions used Confluence KB_
   🟢 No-auth for public KB

3. **Slack** (OAuth required, post to #eng-oncall)
   _Rationale: "Escalate critical tickets with context. OAuth required for channel posting."_
   _Precedent: 31 missions used Slack escalations_
   🟡 OAuth required

Sam selects all three and authorizes:
- ☑ **Zendesk** — Connect Link OAuth flow → Authorizes `tickets:read`, `tickets:comment` scopes
- ☑ **Confluence** — No-auth for public KB (sufficient for this mission)
- ☑ **Slack** — Connect Link OAuth flow → Authorizes `chat:write`, `channels:read` scopes

**Toolkit Status:**
- Zendesk: 🟢 Connected (OAuth complete)
- Confluence: 🟢 Connected (no-auth, public KB only)
- Slack: 🟢 Connected (OAuth complete)

### Data Inspection

Sam clicks **Inspect Data Coverage**. The system runs read-only probes:

- **Zendesk Preview:**
  - 47 tickets match filters (priority: high, created: last 4 hours, tags: "api-error")
  - Issue types detected:
    - Authentication failures: 28 tickets
    - Rate limit errors: 12 tickets
    - Timeout errors: 7 tickets
  - SLA status: 41 within SLA, 6 approaching breach (1h 20m remaining)

- **Confluence KB Coverage:**
  - Matched KB articles:
    - "Troubleshooting API Authentication Errors" (verified, updated Oct 2025)
    - "Rate Limit Best Practices" (verified, updated Sep 2025)
    - "API Timeout Mitigation Guide" (verified, updated Oct 2025)
  - Coverage: **98%** (2 tickets require escalation due to novel error codes)

- **Safeguard Review:**
  - SLA compliance: ✓ (triage window: 45 min, well within 2-hour SLA)
  - Tone validation: ✓ (empathetic, non-technical templates ready)
  - Escalation criteria: ✓ (novel errors, customer tier: Enterprise+)

**Coverage Summary:**
- ✓ Objectives (100%)
- ✓ Tickets (Zendesk: 47 tickets)
- ✓ Knowledge Base (Confluence: 3 verified articles, 98% coverage)
- ✓ Safeguards (SLA, tone, escalation criteria validated)
- ✓ Automation readiness (98%)

Sam proceeds to Stage 3.

**Telemetry Emitted:**
- `toolkit_recommended` (toolkit_id: "zendesk", precedent_count: 23)
- `toolkit_recommended` (toolkit_id: "confluence", precedent_count: 15)
- `toolkit_recommended` (toolkit_id: "slack", precedent_count: 31)
- `toolkit_selected` (toolkit_id: "zendesk", auth_status: "oauth_complete")

## Stage 3: Plan & Approve

### Planner Streaming

The Planner agent streams candidate plays:

**Play 1: "Automated Triage & Response with Escalation"**
_Confidence: 0.91 · Library Match: 8 similar support missions_

**Rationale:**
"Categorizes tickets by issue type, drafts empathetic responses using KB articles, escalates novel errors to #eng-oncall. Maintains SLA compliance. Undo plan: comments remain in draft state until approval."

**Steps:**
1. Fetch and categorize 47 tickets (auth, rate-limit, timeout)
2. Draft responses for resolvable issues (35 tickets) using KB articles
3. Identify escalation-required tickets (12 tickets: 10 novel errors + 2 Enterprise+ SLA risks)
4. Post escalation summaries to #eng-oncall with ticket links and error context
5. Package evidence bundle (categorization report, draft responses, escalation log)

**Undo Plan:**
"All responses remain in draft state. No tickets closed. Escalations posted to #eng-oncall (public channel, no undo required). Evidence bundle retained."

**Safeguards Enforced:**
- ✓ Empathetic, non-technical tone (validator active)
- ✓ KB-verified responses only (no speculation)
- ✓ SLA monitoring (first response <2 hours)
- ✓ Escalation criteria enforced (novel errors, Enterprise+ tier)

---

**Play 2: "Batch Close with Templated Responses"**
_Confidence: 0.68 · Library Match: 2 missions_

**Rationale:**
"Closes all tickets with templated responses. Faster but less personalized. Higher risk of customer dissatisfaction."

Sam dismisses Play 2 (wants personalized drafts, not batch close).

---

| **Impact**       | High       | 47 tickets, SLA risk for 6 tickets       |
| **Reversibility**| High       | Drafts only; no tickets closed           |
| **Safeguards**   | Complete   | Tone, SLA, escalation criteria enforced  |
| **Precedent**    | Strong     | 8 similar missions, 4.6/5 avg rating     |

### Approval Modal

Sam clicks **Request Approval**. The modal summarizes:

```
