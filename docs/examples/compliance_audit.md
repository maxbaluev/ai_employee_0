## Journey Snapshot

`Home → Define → Prepare → Plan → Approve → Execute → Reflect`

| Stage | What Gabriela Experiences | Telemetry Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Home** | Governance dashboard tile shows 142 missions pending review with amber readiness badge (“Needs data: Evidence hash sync”). Alert rail spotlights 12 validator escalations. | `home_tile_opened`, `readiness_badge_rendered`, `alert_rail_viewed` |
| **Define** | Intent banner captures “Audit Q3 missions for safeguard adherence, validator escalations, evidence integrity.” She adds safeguards for “Hash validation” and “Override justification review” before locking brief. | `intent_submitted`, `brief_generated`, `safeguard_added`, `mission_brief_locked` |
| **Prepare** | Tool cards explain scopes: **Supabase** (read evidence + telemetry), **Composio Audit** (read tool executions), **Slack** (notify governance group). Evidence sync completes, readiness badge flips green. Data preview clusters missions by risk profile. | `toolkit_recommended`, `toolkit_connected`, `data_preview_generated`, `readiness_status_changed` |
| **Plan** | Best Plan “Full Coverage Audit” summarises steps (hash verification, override review, sampling). Alternatives collapse (“Spot check 20 missions” flagged as insufficient). Alert rail highlights 8 safeguard overrides requiring manual attention. | `planner_candidate_generated`, `plan_ranked`, `plan_adjusted`, `risk_alert_created` |
| **Approve** | Compliance director receives printable summary with mission scope, safeguards, undo window (rollback limited to evidence tagging), outstanding tasks. Approval note captured for audit vault. | `approval_requested`, `approval_granted`, `audit_event_recorded` |
| **Execute** | Live checklist tracks `Fetch telemetry`, `Validate hashes`, `Review overrides`, `Compile report`. Alert rail surfaces two missing evidence bundles; Gabriela launches quick re-ingest fixes. Undo banner offers 20-minute rollback for tag changes. | `execution_started`, `execution_step_completed`, `validator_alert_raised`, `undo_available` |
| **Reflect** | Outcome snapshot shows “142 missions vetted · 8 gaps flagged · 3 policies updated · 4h saved.” Evidence gallery stores hash reports, override notes, exportable SOC 2 package. Feedback drawer logs 5★ rating with note (“Auto-suggest policy templates next cycle”). | `mission_completed`, `evidence_opened`, `feedback_submitted`, `policy_task_created` |

## Stage Detail

### Home — Governance Command Centre
- Readiness badge ensures Gabriela tackles evidence sync before diving into detail.
- Alert rail pre-filters escalations by severity so she can assign support if needed.

### Define — Audit Charter
- Conversational intake anchored by compliance examples guides Gabriela to note frameworks (SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA) and override scrutiny.
- Safeguard drawer confirms validator coverage for PII and policy deviations.

### Prepare — Access & Context
- Supabase read scopes described without jargon (“View mission telemetry and evidence hashes”).
- Data preview groups missions with overrides, giving Gabriela a head start on sampling and focus areas.
- Readiness badge turning green confirms all data sources aligned before planning.

### Plan — Full Coverage with Clarity
- Best Plan emphasises comprehensive hash validation, override review, and policy recommendation loops.
- Alternatives remain available (spot check, delegate) but collapsed unless time-constrained.
- Alert rail binds override count, aiding prioritisation.

### Approve — Governance Sign-Off
- Compliance director reviews read-only summary; justification note stored with approval metadata.
- Approval record feeds directly into audit log for downstream certification requirements.

### Execute — Governed Run
- Live checklist shows progress without verbose logs; Gabriela can dive deeper per step if needed.
- Missing evidence or failed hashes surface via alert rail with direct “Re-run sync” actions.
- Undo banner covers metadata changes, ensuring reversible tagging decisions.

### Reflect — Institutional Memory
- Outcome snapshot quantifies risk posture; evidence gallery compiles reports for auditors.
- Follow-up checklist spawns tasks: update policies, inform teams, schedule committee review.
- Feedback captured to improve next quarter’s audit workflow.
