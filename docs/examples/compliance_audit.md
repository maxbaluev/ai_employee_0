# Case Study: Governance & Compliance ‚Äî Quarterly Mission Audit & Safeguard Review

**Persona:** Gabriela Torres, Governance & Compliance Lead
**Industry:** Enterprise B2B SaaS (Financial Services Vertical)
**Mission Date:** October 2025
**Mission Duration:** 68 minutes (Define to Evidence)
**Outcome:** 142 missions audited, 8 safeguard gaps identified, 3 policy recommendations generated

---

## Executive Summary

Gabriela is responsible for quarterly compliance reviews of AI Employee Control Plane missions to ensure safeguards are enforced, audit trails are complete, and regulatory requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA) are met. In Q3 2025, the platform processed 142 missions across revenue, support, and operations teams. Gabriela needs to:

1. Audit all missions for safeguard adherence and validator effectiveness
2. Identify missions with safeguard overrides or validator escalations
3. Verify evidence bundles are complete and tamper-proof (hash validation)
4. Generate compliance reports for internal audit and external certification
5. Recommend policy improvements based on patterns

This case study demonstrates how the **five-stage mission journey** supports governance and compliance workflows:

1. **Define** ‚Äî Capture audit objectives and compliance criteria
2. **Prepare** ‚Äî Validate access to mission telemetry and evidence storage
3. **Plan & Approve** ‚Äî Review audit plays and evidence sampling strategy
4. **Execute & Observe** ‚Äî Governed audit execution with integrity checks
5. **Reflect & Improve** ‚Äî Generate compliance reports and policy recommendations

---

## Stage 1: Define

### Intent Submission

Gabriela opens the Control Plane at 2:15pm on October 31st and enters:

```
Audit all missions completed in Q3 2025 for compliance review.
Focus on safeguard adherence, validator effectiveness, and evidence integrity.
Identify missions with safeguard overrides, validator escalations, or missing evidence.
Generate compliance reports for SOC 2 audit (data access controls, audit trails, safeguards).
Recommend policy improvements based on patterns (e.g., common safeguard gaps).
Redact PII in all reports for external sharing.
```

## Stage 2: Prepare

### Toolkit Recommendations

The system suggests:

1. **Supabase (Direct Query)** (service role key required, read-only)
   _Rationale: "Access mission telemetry tables (`mission_metadata`, `mission_safeguards`, `mission_approvals`, `telemetry_events`). Read-only queries for audit."_
   _Precedent: 6 governance missions used direct Supabase access_
   üü° Service role key required

2. **Supabase Storage** (service role key required, read-only)
   _Rationale: "Access evidence bundles for hash validation and completeness checks."_
   _Precedent: 6 governance missions validated evidence storage_
   üü° Service role key required

3. **Google Sheets** (OAuth optional, export reports)
   _Rationale: "Export compliance dashboards and audit findings for stakeholder review."_
   _Precedent: 4 missions exported to Google Sheets_
   üü° OAuth optional

Gabriela selects:
- ‚òë **Supabase (Direct Query)** ‚Äî Uses existing service role key (read-only)
- ‚òë **Supabase Storage** ‚Äî Uses existing service role key (read-only)
- ‚òê **Google Sheets** ‚Äî Defers (will export as CSV instead)

**Toolkit Status:**

## Stage 3: Plan & Approve

### Planner Streaming

The Planner agent streams candidate plays:

**Play 1: "Comprehensive Mission Audit with Evidence Validation"**
_Confidence: 0.93 ¬∑ Library Match: 6 similar governance missions_

**Rationale:**
"Queries mission telemetry for safeguard adherence, validator effectiveness, and approval workflows. Validates evidence bundle hashes for integrity. Identifies patterns in safeguard overrides and validator escalations. Generates compliance reports for SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA. Undo plan: read-only queries, no mutations."

**Steps:**
1. Query mission telemetry for 142 missions (safeguards, approvals, validator events)
2. Validate evidence bundle hashes (121 bundles)
3. Identify missions with safeguard overrides (8 flagged) and validator escalations (12 flagged)
4. Cluster safeguard gaps by pattern (tone, timing, budget, data-access, compliance)
5. Generate compliance reports:
   - SOC 2: Data access controls, audit trails, safeguard enforcement
   - GDPR: Data access logs, PII redaction, consent tracking
   - CCPA: Data access requests, deletion logs
6. Recommend policy improvements based on pattern analysis
7. Package evidence bundle (audit report, findings, recommendations)

**Undo Plan:**
"Read-only queries only. No mission data modified. Audit trail generated for all data access."

**Safeguards Enforced:**
- ‚úì Read-only access to mission telemetry and evidence storage
- ‚úì PII redaction in all reports
- ‚úì Audit trail for data access
- ‚úì Secure export for SOC 2 audit package

---

**Play 2: "Spot Check Audit (Sample 20 Missions)"**
_Confidence: 0.71 ¬∑ Library Match: 2 missions_

**Rationale:**
"Faster but less comprehensive. Samples 20 missions for review. Suitable for low-risk environments."

Gabriela dismisses Play 2 (requires comprehensive audit for SOC 2 certification).

## Stage 5: Reflect & Improve

### Feedback Drawer

Gabriela opens the feedback drawer at 3:23pm (68 minutes after mission start):

**Quick Reaction:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)

**Effort Saved:** "4 hours of manual audit and report generation"

**Qualitative Feedback:**
```
Hash validation automation saved significant time‚Äîmanual checks would have taken hours.
Pattern clustering identified safeguard gaps I hadn't noticed manually.
SOC 2 report is audit-ready; no additional formatting needed.
Policy recommendations are actionable and backed by data.
Audit trail for data access provides confidence for external auditors.
```

**Suggested Improvement:**
```
Consider adding automated trend analysis (quarter-over-quarter safeguard adherence).
Flag missions with repeat safeguard overrides for deeper review.
```

### Library Contribution

The system prompts:

```
This play performed well and matches 6 similar governance missions.
Would you like to contribute it to the team library?

- Add budget range preview in Plan & Approve stage.
- Require explicit approval for missions with budget >$10K.
- Integrate budget validation with finance system APIs for real-time checks.

**Expected Impact:** Eliminate budget escalations, improve approval confidence.

---

### Recommendation 3: Auto-Escalate Data-Access Safeguards for Sensitive Customer Data

**Context:** 34 data-access auto-fixes and 4 escalations across all teams.

**Recommendation:**
