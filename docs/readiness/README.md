## Required Evidence Artifacts

As referenced in **[Release Readiness](./09_release_readiness.md)** and **[Capability Roadmap](./05_capability_roadmap.md)**, the following artifacts must be generated:

### Foundation Milestone
- [ ] `intake_acceptance_report.md` — Generative intake acceptance rate analysis
- [ ] `inspection_resilience.md` — Inspection streaming heartbeat and error recovery validation
- [ ] `toolkit_recommendation_accuracy.md` — Toolkit scoring and recommendation quality metrics

### Core Milestone
- [ ] `oauth_scope_audit.md` — OAuth Connect Link scope transparency and security review
- [ ] `safeguard_learning_loop.md` — Adaptive safeguard feedback loop effectiveness analysis
- [ ] `library_reuse_metrics.md` — Library play reuse rates and embedding quality

### Scale Milestone
- [ ] `observability_dashboard.md` — Unified metrics dashboard validation
- [ ] `runbook_validation.md` — Incident response runbook testing and completeness check
- [ ] `undo_efficacy.md` — Undo plan success rates and rollback latency analysis

## Evidence Artifact Template

Each evidence artifact should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Capability Name] — Evidence Report

**Milestone:** [Foundation | Core | Scale]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Team/Individual]
**Status:** [✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not Started]

---

## Objective

[What capability is being validated and why]

---

## Test Methodology

[How evidence was collected: manual tests, automated scripts, telemetry analysis, user studies]

---

## Results

### Quantitative Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Example metric | ≥80% | 87% | ✅ Pass |

### Qualitative Findings
- Finding 1
- Finding 2

---

## Evidence Artifacts

- Link to test results
- Link to telemetry dashboards
- Link to recorded demos
- Link to user feedback

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|----------|------------|-------|
| Example risk | High | Mitigation plan | Name |

---

## Sign-Off

- [ ] Product Manager
- [ ] Engineering Lead
- [ ] Operations Lead
- [ ] Security Lead (if applicable)
- [ ] Compliance Lead (if applicable)

---

## Next Steps

- Action item 1
- Action item 2

---

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Next Review:** [Date or milestone trigger]
```

---

## Creating Evidence Artifacts

**Manual Process (Current):**
1. Copy template above
2. Execute tests and collect data
3. Populate metrics and findings
4. Link to supporting artifacts (screenshots, logs, dashboards)
5. Submit for cross-functional review
6. Collect sign-offs in release tracker

**Automation Roadmap (Future):**
- Script to auto-generate evidence from CI/CD telemetry and test results
- Automated sign-off tracking via Git commits or project management tool
- Evidence bundle export for compliance audits

---

## Maintenance

- **Retention:** Current release artifacts kept indefinitely in repo
- **Archive:** Previous release artifacts moved to `YYYY_MM_archived/` after 2 releases
- **Review Cadence:** Quarterly review of evidence artifact quality and completeness
- **Ownership:** Release Management and Product Leadership
