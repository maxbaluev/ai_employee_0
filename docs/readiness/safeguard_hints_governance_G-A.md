# Gate G-A — Safeguard Hints Governance Framework

The Gate G-A dry-run workflow surfaces tone, quiet hours, undo plans, and
escalation guidance. Governance stakeholders agreed on the following
controls during the 2025-10-08 review.

## Roles

- **Runtime Steward** — curates default hints and monitors telemetry.
- **Governance Sentinel** — approves changes to guardrail language and
  escalation procedures.
- **Product Design** — ensures hints align with UX copy and accessibility
  guidelines.

## Operating Procedures

1. **Generation** — Hints are generated by the intake service; each hint is
   tagged with `status = 'suggested'` and a confidence score.
2. **Review** — Governance Sentinel reviews weekly exports filtered by
   `status IN ('suggested','edited')` for high-value tenants.
3. **Approval** — Accepted hints are marked `status = 'accepted'` and the
   rationale is copied into `mission_safeguards.rationale`.
4. **Escalation** — If a hint requires human oversight, the Sentinel sets
   `status = 'escalate'` and provides a reviewer contact in the rationale.
5. **Telemetry** — All transitions are logged via `safeguard_events` to
   preserve an immutable audit trail.

## Evidence

- `docs/readiness/db_checksum_G-A.csv` — verifies `mission_safeguards`
  schema and integrity.
- `docs/readiness/safeguard_hints_governance_G-A.md` (this file) — captures
  agreed workflow and responsibilities.
- `scripts/test_copilotkit_persistence.py` — exercises `copilotkit_exit`
  telemetry and safeguard logging.

## Sign-off

- Runtime Steward — ✅ 2025-10-09
- Governance Sentinel — ✅ 2025-10-09
