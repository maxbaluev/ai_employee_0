# CopilotKit QA â€” Gate G-A

Use this folder to store screenshots and notes that demonstrate mission
persistence across reloads. Capture the following once the UI is wired to
Supabase:

- Mission intake before refresh
- Database rows created in `objectives` and `copilot_sessions`
- Workspace state after refresh confirming restored mission brief

Place image files in this directory and reference them from the status
beacon when ready.
