# Gate G-A — Completion Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Owner:** Runtime Steward

## Technical Readiness

- ADK orchestration passes the five-scenario smoke suite (`mise run
  test-agent`).
- Supabase schema, indexes, and RLS policies verified via
  `scripts/test_supabase_persistence.py`.
- CopilotKit sessions, messages, and completion events persist through the
  offline Supabase client (`scripts/test_copilotkit_persistence.py`).
- Evidence artifacts stored under `docs/readiness/` for audits and future
  gate reviews.

## Documentation Snapshot

- `docs/readiness/migration_log_G-A.md` — migration transcript, checksums,
  and RLS validation.
- `docs/readiness/db_checksum_G-A.csv` — deterministic SHA-256 hashes of
  table definitions.
- `docs/readiness/cron_scheduling_G-A.md` — scheduled jobs and monitoring
  plan.
- `docs/readiness/safeguard_hints_governance_G-A.md` — governance SOP.
- `docs/readiness/copilotkit_qa_G-A/test_results.txt` — persistence QA log.

## Outstanding Operational Tasks

- Deploy documented cron jobs to the live Supabase project.
- Capture UI screenshots once CopilotKit is connected to the production
  database.

All engineering deliverables for Gate G-A are complete and evidence is
stored in version control. Proceed to Gate G-B planning after the
operations checklist above is closed.
