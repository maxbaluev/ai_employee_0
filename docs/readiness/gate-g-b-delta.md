# Gate G-B Delta — October 11, 2025

## Implemented Enhancements
- Artifact export & share actions (CSV/PDF download, share links) from evidence gallery.
- Pinned Mission Brief Card rendering accepted intake chips across all stages.
- Evidence SHA-256 hash display with accessible copy-to-clipboard control and telemetry.

## Key Paths
- `src/app/(control-plane)/ControlPlaneWorkspace.tsx`
- `src/components/MissionBriefCard.tsx`
- `src/app/api/artifacts/export/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/artifacts/share/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/artifacts/share/[token]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/missions/[missionId]/brief/route.ts`

## Manual Verification
1. Accept a generated mission intake; confirm Mission Brief Card persists through subsequent stages.
2. Download artifact CSV/PDF and copy share link; ensure alerts fire and files download.
3. Click “Copy” on evidence hash; verify truncated UI, clipboard contents, and telemetry event (`evidence_hash_copied`).
