# Gate G-B Evidence Index

Generated: October 14, 2025  
Maintainer: Control Plane Runtime Crew

This index surfaces every readiness artifact produced for Gate G-B so reviewers can trace evidence back to source material. Each row links to the canonical file in this repository; generated JSON/CSV artefacts are accompanied by the script or workflow that produces them.

## Change Log
- 2025-10-14 · Initial index generated to consolidate evidence pointers for promotion review.
- 2025-10-14 · Added Appendix A alignment rows and archive manifest reference.

## Outstanding Artifacts
- CopilotKit session video, stream metrics export, and performance benchmark report are scheduled post 2025-10-15 dry run. Rows above are marked with **Status** notes until uploads land.
- Backend telemetry audit remains blocked on CI secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`). Update this index once the workflow runs and produces `telemetry_backend_G-B.md`.
- Evidence samples bundle export will land once `scripts/export_evidence_bundle.py` is executed against the latest missions.
- Inspect coverage screenshot (`docs/readiness/inspect_coverage_meter_G-B.png`) will be captured alongside Stage 4 QA walkthrough on 2025-10-15.
